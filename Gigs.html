  <h3> Introduction </h3>
      <p>If music is considered the best language to bring people together, live music is the grammar of that language. Gigs and bands are exsisting in every corner of the world, from small towns to big cities, but it is such a challenge for people to know about them, as small indie gigs and bands are not usually well-advertised. Bandfinder is create based on the idea to connect gigs and bands with exsisted audiences as well as potential audiences, letting their informations like showtimes, locations and gernes widely reachable in the matter of seconds.</p>

  <h3> Design Process </h3>
      <p>I have thought of many ideas on how to further develop this from my privious project. My goal is to create a real-time database platform, but compact so people can bring and use it everywhere. Simple searching app is not enough, so I decide to do a AR version of it.</p>

      <p>Basically, if you see a poster anywhere on the street, you can just pick up your phone, scan it and all of the information about that show/performance will show up.</p>
